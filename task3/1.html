        <p>my name is Elena Sanchez. I am from Mexico, but now I live in California. I'm a student here in English language classes at a small college.</span>
            I live in an apartment building. It's on the corner of Olive Street and Sycamore Avenue. My address is 2201 Olive Street. There's a big olive tree in front of the building. There's a park across the street. There are a lot of oak trees in the park. The trees are beautiful in the summer.
            A lot of my neighbors are from different countries. The people next to me are from Indonesia. The family across from the Indonesian family is from Colombia.
            The stores in this neighborhood are always busy. There's a Korean drugstore and an Armenian flower shop.
            There are three restaurants on Olive Street: One Mexican, one Japanese, and one Moroccan-Italian-American.
            I like my neighborhood, but I ask myself one question. Where are the Americans?!!!
